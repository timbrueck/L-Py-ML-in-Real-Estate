# How to apply Data Science and Machine Learning to Real Estate

[Nelson Lau - How to apply Data Science and ML to Real Estate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSQvso6fD-c)

## Property Price Indices

Challenge: Transaction price data for the same property is not available at regular intervals. Only infrequent transaction data on heterogeneous properties. 

Idea: Producing an idea of market performance and controlling for quality differences using statistical methods.

## Automated Valuation Models

self explainatory

## Time series Forecasting

Methodology: ARIMA | VAR | VECM | ML

possible (relevant) future values to forecast
- Macroeconomic data
- property market data

## Cluster Analysis

### Clustering Properties

Grouping properties or locations based on similar characteristics

Use Cases:

- Checking for grade of diversification in a portfolio
  - diversifying between many clusters
- Detecting under- / overvalued properties
- Analyzing buyer- / seller-patterns

### Clustering macro-economic conditions

Use Cases:

- producing a property market cycle analysis
  - clustering marcro-economic conditions and rating them to identify the current spot in the market cycle and acting accordingly

## Geospatial Analysis

Studying location factors 
- e.g. producing a heat map for attractiveness of different locations
  - applicable for different types of property 
- showcasing coverage / density of certain properties
- rain-, light- intensity in different locations

A lot of use cases in both the application in valuation models and site selection

## Further

### Computer Vision

- e.g. implementing computer vision to gain more detailed information for valuation models
- checking condition of amenities in public listings
- Training valuation models accordingly

### Floor plan analytics
  
- Evaluate floor plan layouts
  - Commercial real estate: optimize space utilization and efficiency
  - Residential real estate: maximize rentable area and assign value based on layout quality
